## 3. Technical Approaches for Challenging Aspects

### Accurate Text Selection in Complex PDF Layouts

- **Implement Text Extraction Logic**
  - Use PyMuPDF's text extraction methods to map text coordinates.
  - Account for multi-column layouts and varying fonts.

- **Coordinate Mapping**
  - Map mouse events to PDF text coordinates accurately.
  - Use a spatial index or quadtree for efficient lookup.

### Efficient Annotation Storage and Retrieval

- **Database Schema Optimization**
  - Design SQLite tables with indexing on frequently queried fields.
  - Normalize data to reduce redundancy.

- **Lazy Loading of Annotations**
  - Load annotations for the visible pages only.
  - Pre-fetch annotations when nearing page boundaries.

---

## 4. Useful Third-Party Libraries and Tools

- **PyMuPDF (fitz)**
  - For PDF rendering and text manipulation.

- **PyQt6**
  - For building the graphical user interface.

- **Requests**
  - For handling HTTP requests to the Perplexity AI API.

- **SQLite (via `sqlite3` or `SQLAlchemy`)**
  - For local data storage of annotations and notes.

- **pytest**
  - For writing and running tests.

- **Sphinx or MkDocs**
  - For generating documentation.

---

## 5. Performance Optimization Strategies

- **PDF Rendering**
  - Implement caching for rendered pages.
  - Use thumbnail previews for faster navigation.

- **Annotation Rendering**
  - Batch render annotations to minimize redraws.
  - Use optimized data structures for in-memory annotation management.

- **Resource Management**
  - Monitor and limit memory usage.
  - Dispose of unused objects promptly.

---

## 6. Cross-Platform Compatibility Approaches

- **Use Cross-Platform Libraries**
  - PyQt6 and PyMuPDF are cross-platform.

- **Avoid OS-Specific Code**
  - When file paths or OS interactions are needed, use Python's `os` and `pathlib` modules.

- **Testing on Multiple Platforms**
  - Regularly test the application on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.

---

## 7. API Rate Limits and Usage Optimization

- **Implement Caching**
  - Cache API responses for repeated queries.
  - Use a time-to-live (TTL) strategy for cache invalidation.

- **Request Throttling**
  - Implement a rate limiter to prevent exceeding API limits.

- **Batch Requests**
  - If the API supports it, batch multiple queries into a single request.

- **User Feedback**
  - Provide visual indicators when API limits are reached.
  - Allow users to retry requests after a cooldown period.

---

## 8. User Authentication and API Key Management

- **Secure Storage of API Keys**
  - Store API keys in encrypted form using keyring libraries like `keyring`.

- **User Authentication Interface**
  - Provide a settings dialog where users can input their API key securely.

- **Environment Variables (For Developers)**
  - Allow the application to read API keys from environment variables during development.
